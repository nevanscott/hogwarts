Project 4 is about exploring a problem/area of opportunity for an existing brand. (You get to choose the problem and the brand!). It’s also about starting to explore and work with technical constraints. 

You will be utilizing the tools you’ve already practiced, including:

* Competitive/comparative analysis
* User research
* Personas
* Synthesis/Documentation
* Sketching
* Wireframing
* Prototyping
* Testing

You will also be performing new activities, including:

* Choosing an appropriate platform (responsive website, native app, wearable) based on the problem and target audience 
* Researching technical constraints
* Writing a proposal
* Developing a project plan
* Presenting to a small audience

In the end, your group will present privately to two instructors in a conversational format. This is great practice for having an in-depth conversation about your work with colleagues, clients, and potential employers. 

This is an opportunity to get creative and work on a project that will set your portfolio apart from others. We’re looking forward to seeing variety in the types of projects and approaches you take.


## Schedule

### Fri, Apr 17

* Things to consider:
  * Brands you like (and opportunities they could explore)
  * Pain points or problem areas that you are already familiar with
  * Current industry trends and current events
* As a group, come up with your top choice for a problem to explore and brand you will be designing for, plus 2-3 backups

#### PROPOSAL

By 6PM on Sunday, each group should upload to the Google Drive a proposal with:

* Initial Problem Statement 
  (1-2 sentence description of your problem)

## Platforms

### Native Mobile App

#### Background

The iPhone was debuted 8 years ago and along with it the popularization of apps. Apps, as opposed to websites, are built in Objective-C (iOS) or Java (Android). These object oriented languages come with a distinct set of difference from web technologies--HTML, CSS, and Javascript--from the programs they are written in, to the performance level of what the languages are built to execute. Access to hardware and OS level commands are the factors you will focus on in this project.  

#### Considerations

If choosing native, provide reasoning for why your product is native and not web based. Decide which platform (i.e. iOS, Android, etc.) you will develop for. If you are diverging from any platform design patterns, be able to answer why. You may also want to consider accessing information through APIs or extending functionality through third party services.

### Responsive Website

#### Background

Creating a website version for each device of different sizes and resolutions like a desktop, iPad, or  Windows phone, would be impractical. Instead, responsive web design is the approach that suggests that a design should automatically respond to the user’s environment based on screen size, platform, and orientation. This eliminates the need to design and develop a separate website for each new gadget that comes to market. Understanding grids, layouts, image sizes, and other properties will be the focus of this project.

#### Considerations

While no functional code is required, include documentation specifying how your design will change at different available viewports. You may also want to consider accessing information through APIs or extending functionality through third party services.

* Your wireframes should include desktop, mobile, and tablet versions (medium-fidelity at least)
* Select at least one viewport size to prototype (at a level of fidelity that is useful for testing and iterating)
* We would like to see at least 1-2 high fidelity screens for at least 2 viewports

### Wearable Application

#### Background

Since the advent of the calculator watch in the 1980s we have been integrating technology into our daily lives through the use of wearable technology, electronic devices that can be worn by users. These devices can range from simple single function devices to OS-powered devices with multiple unique applications. 

Today we have complex “smart” watches that can take pictures and make phones calls (see Moto360 or Apple Watch). These devices allow for affordances and sometimes features beyond typical web-based or native mobile applications.

#### Considerations

Provide reasoning for why your product is designed for a wearable device. Decide which device and platform you will design for and be able to answer how you are leveraging the unique capabilities. You may also want to consider accessing information through APIs or extending functionality through third party services.

Please choose a GUI-based device such as a smart watch (for example, Apple Watch and NOT a Fitbit or Fuelband). **It is highly likely that you will also be designing for a portion of a native mobile companion app.**

Please note that your task is to design an application for a currently existing wearable device. This is not a task in designing hardware.

For the wearable component of your prototype, consider getting creative with paper and/or .gifs.
