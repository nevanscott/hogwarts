## Outline of what we did to synthesize findings from our interviews and develop & prioritize a set of features

1. Synthesize with Affinity Mapping
    1. Make post-its of your findings from your interviews
    2. Start grouping them to identify patterns, creating labels for your groupings as you go
    3. Grouping ideas:
        * Demographic segments
        * Degree of Motivation
        * Time
        * Place
        * Amount of Labor in a Behavior
    4. Record common problems that you see
2. Generate features:
    * Users will be able to...
3. Prioritize
    * High priority to low priority
    * Easy to Difficult
