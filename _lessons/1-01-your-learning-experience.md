You have the freedom to:

* fail
* experiment
* make mistakes
* try new things

Think of a time you had a *negative* learning experience.

What ground ruls would you like to set to make this a *great* learning experience?


## Setting Goals

Make the *most* of this experience.

In other words, do *not* get in your own way.

Your *gremlins* disempower your beliefs:

* Listening to your Inner Critic
* Trying to maintain the status quo
* State of resistance
* Living in fear
* Self-defeating habits
* Negative stories you tell yourself

Strategies to *tame* your gremlins:

* Maintain a state of awareness
* Be open minded
* Maintain a sense of curiosity
* Have compassion
* Have a sense of humor
* Be playful

Remember to *maintain* a work life balance:

* Yoga
* Music
* Meditation
* Exercise
