Meetupâ€™s mission is to revitalize local community and help people around the world self-organize. Meetup makes it easy for anyone to organize a local group or find one of the thousands already meeting up face-to-face. In furtherance of its mission, Meetup would like to provide new tools to allow organizations and companies with space available after hours for such meetups to promote their space and attract Meetup Organizers to get in touch, coordinate, and book space for Meetup events.

The Problem/Opportunity
-----------------------

The Meetup website and apps are currently designed with two primary audiences in mind: Meetup Organizers and Meetup Members. Currently Organizers are responsible for finding and booking space for meetups on their own. Likewise, companies with space available for such Meetups either start and organize their own Meetups, or reach out separately to Meetup organizers to offer the usage of their space. Meetup would like to create a first-class means through its website and apps to increase the ability of Organizers and Hosts to find one another.

Aspects to Consider
-------------------

* Meetup charges Organizers at different levels based on their needs
* Meetup Members are not charged, but Organizers can choose to charge a fee to attend events
* Meetup has not yet determined whether or not to charge Hosts, or whether Hosts may be able to offer their space for a booking fee

Features
--------

* Organizers should be able to find prospective spaces and reach out to their point of contact
* Hosts should be able to promote their space to Organizers
* Organizers and Hosts may be able to identify one another based on shared interests

Target Device
-------------

* Desktop Web or Native Mobile app
