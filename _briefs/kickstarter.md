Kickstarter is a crowdsourcing website that allows people to fund projects posted to their site. They want to expand the types of projects to include ones that require recurring payments.

The Problem/Opportunity
-----------------------

Currently people can back different projects by pledging a certain amount of money to a project. Projects are only funded if they reach their funding goal by a predetermined date. Kickstarter wants to expand to allow projects that will be funded on a repeated schedule instead of only backing a project once. 

Aspects to Consider
-------------------

* Differentiate between what kinds of projects might fit better into this new offering
* Consider how this would compare to other subscription services

Features
--------

* Creators should be able to launch projects that require recurring payments
* Backers should be able to discover and fund these projects

Target Device
-------------

* Desktop Web or Native iPhone/Android app
