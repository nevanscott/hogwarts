Twitch wants to increase customer engagement by introducing a feature that allows users to upload video game walkthroughs.

The Problem/Opportunity
-----------------------

Walkthroughs are used to help gamers get through difficult parts, find secrets and hard to locate items, or to be an exhaustive guide to fully completing a game. Currently Twitch allows gamers to broadcast their gameplay, but lacks the ability to let other gamers find specific parts of a game. Twitch wants to introduce a new way of uploading and viewing content, allowing gamers to share their tips and tricks with one another and make a profit while doing the thing they love.

Aspects to Consider
-------------------

* Walkthrough creators and consumers occupy two separate user experiences
* How does this differ from guidebook, online walkthroughs, and Youtube videos that users may already be familiar with
* We are assuming that walkthrough creators will already have a video recording

Features
--------

* Creators should be able to upload game walkthroughs
* Consumers should be able to discover walkthroughs that appeal to them
* Consumers should be able to find specific moments in a walkthrough

Target Devices
--------------

* Responsive website that works well with iPad
