As the go-to place for reviews on restaurants, businesses, and various services and experiences, Yelp wants to increase user engagement by appealing to travelers.

The Problem/Opportunity
-----------------------

People use Yelp to find all sorts of things—especially when they’re on vacation and in an unfamiliar place. Yelp wants to expand their offerings to be the go-to place for travelers planning their trips. They would like to have a feature that allows users to create itineraries for their travels, as well as a record of their actual experiences. 

Aspects to Consider
-------------------

* Yelp currently has a “Lists” feature tucked away on its website
* Consider how this would compare to TripAdvisor’s offerings

Features
--------

* Users should be able to create itineraries with designated locations/services
* Users should be able to “record” all the experiences of their trip

Target Device
-------------

* Native iPhone or Android app
