Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance,  Trello tells you what's being worked on, whoâ€™s working on what, and where something is in a process.

The Problem/Opportunity
-----------------------

Trello provides a place for collaborators to contribute and organize projects in a digital workspace. Users can create boards and contribute resources, but the conversation surrounding these boards and resources is often lost. Trello wants to increase user engagement by creating a better chat feature for individuals collaborating with Trello.

Aspects to Consider
-------------------

* What sort of features do users expect with a chat application?
* How to ensure quality conversation and engagement surrounding resources and boards
* Keep your different users in mind: more active users, more observant users, etc.
* Should direct messages play a role?

Features
--------

* Users should be able to engage in conversation on Trello in the form of chat
* Ideally, users should be able to easily start new chats on specific topics/resources, without overwhelming users

Target Device
-------------

* Desktop web
