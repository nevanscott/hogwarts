As a mobile application that specializes in curating and displaying a user’s past activities on various social networks, Timehop wants to broaden its customer base through a new group storytelling feature.

The Problem/Opportunity
-----------------------

Timehop provides a means for users to reconnect with memories of their past experiences by reaching into social media content posted in 1-year increments from the date viewed. While the experience of revisiting this content has demonstrated value in its ability to delight users, Timehop would like to evolve beyond static, disparate posts that offer only a glimpse into the past, and incorporate a new “stories” feature that would expand access to friends who shared that memory or experience, allowing groups of friends to fashion together the full story behind a memorable experience or event.

Aspects to Consider
-------------------

* Interval of story moments - how often are they made available? Consider Facebook’s year-end reviews, among other examples.
* What does this story look like, how does it work, both from a creation and a viewing standpoint?

Features
--------

* Users should be able to create a story with a group of friends
* Users should be able to view stories and share or contribute to them

Target Device
-------------

* Native iPhone or Android app
