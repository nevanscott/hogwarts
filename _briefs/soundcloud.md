As the world’s leading social sound platform where people can create and share sounds, SoundCloud wants to expand the way users interactively share music.

The Problem/Opportunity
-----------------------

SoundCloud provides a place for musicians to record, upload, promote and share their sounds for listeners to access around the world. SoundCloud users are able to “like” artist tracks, follow artists, create playlists, and join groups to support and grow the SoundCloud community. Although users are able to curate their own playlists from songs they select, SoundCloud would like to create a feature that allows users to collaborate online, DJing their select tracks with other users in real time. 

Aspects to Consider
-------------------

* How will users DJ together online, in real time at the same time?
* How will SoundCloud users listen/join in on this live experience? 

Features
--------

* DJs should be able to select tracks and take turns playing songs
* DJs should be able to capture and share their DJ sets
* Listeners should be able to join rooms and listen to live DJ sets

Target Device
-------------

* Responsive Website that works well with iPad and/or iPhone
