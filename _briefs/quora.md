Quora is a question-and-answer website where questions are created, answered, edited and organized by its community of users. Quora prides themselves on the quality of content their users produce and want to capitalize on this expert content by providing paid, group Q&A sessions.

The Problem/Opportunity
-----------------------

With the growing popularity of AMA (Ask Me Anything) style interviews on Reddit and elsewhere, Quora sees an opportunity to leverage their expert user base by introducing video AMAs as a paid service for its users.

Aspects to Consider
-------------------

* AMAs are typically text based
* Quora uses a point system to let users “pay” experts to answer their questions 
* Timing of AMAs and how long they typically last
* What to do for overload of questions (look up what it’s like for the interview subject) 

Features
--------

* Viewers should be able to ask and vote (up or down) questions
* Viewers should be able to search, discover, and browse AMAs
* Experts may be able to conduct video and/or text-based exchanges

Target Device
-------------

* Desktop Web app
